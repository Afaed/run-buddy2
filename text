#id class
hex code color codes are pretty useful

Box model
priority system where elements are listed by importance. 
If we have header and footer. we can pick a 
certain element by checking their class tag.

But what happens if we have an element with two different section?

we can select it by its id. for instance
#contact-section {background color: blue;}
section {background-color: red;}

The more specific it is-the more prioritized it is over 
the braod section.
